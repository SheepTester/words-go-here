> [!NOTE]

> This repo was originally going to be where I would make my own text editor, as part of a brief trend on Advanced Topics (maybe [this one](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/233993/)?), hence the name "words go here."
> I gave up fairly quickly, so now the repo has been repurposed to host miscellaneous web pages in [`misc/`](https://sheeptester.github.io/words-go-here/misc/).
> In terms of quality, these pages generally sit below [/javascripts/](https://sheeptester.github.io/javascripts/) and above [/hello-world/](https://sheeptester.github.io/hello-world/).

<!-- >
> That doesn't mean the pages are all bad, though. Sometimes, they even grow out of this nest:
>
> - `scratch3-htmlifier/` was moved to [HTMLifier](https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/)
> - `kaaba/` was the basis of [Doufu](https://sheeptester.github.io/doufu/) -->

<!-- > - `pan-rotate-zoom.html`, an improvement over UGWA's  -->

<!-- > - `animated-painting-maker.html` never moved out, but according to Google Search it's one of the more popular pages. -->

<!-- > - `simplex.html`, which I translated from Scratch to JavaScript once, has been copy-pasted to a few other places, like Doufu (above). -->
